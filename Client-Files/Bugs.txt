1) File progress not getting reset for file sender. //Fixed
2) Disconnect for room joiner not works properly // Till analysis - When room creator disconnects , 
then room joiner gets disconnect and room creator not.
3) When room is full it should not disabled buttons .



First Last Work - "Identitfy that socket is different and room is different , when we leave room socket will not
            close " , last day added user identifier in client side and that name emits to server when disconnect
            event start "

20-02-2020 - "Refactor the server side socket connection code and remove currentUserSocketId and seperate it into
                roomCreator and roomJoiner ID . because server side need the room joiner socket ID when room creator 
                hits disconnect call , so room joiner can be disconnect automatically.

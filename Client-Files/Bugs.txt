            event start "

20-02-2020 - "Refactor the server side socket connection code and remove currentUserSocketId and seperate it into
                roomCreator and roomJoiner ID . because server side need the room joiner socket ID when room creator 
                hits disconnect call , so room joiner can be disconnect automatically.
